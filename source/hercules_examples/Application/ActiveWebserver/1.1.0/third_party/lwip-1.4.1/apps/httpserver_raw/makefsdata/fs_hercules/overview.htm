Hercules safety microcontrollers are based on TI's 20+ years of safety-critical system expertise, industry collaboration and proven hardware for the automotive market. The platform consists of three ARM® Cortex®-based microcontroller families (Hercules RM, TMS570 and TMS470M) that deliver scalable performance, connectivity, memory and safety features. Unlike many microcontrollers that rely heavily on software for safety capabilities, Hercules microcontrollers implement safety in hardware to maximize performance and reduce software overhead.
