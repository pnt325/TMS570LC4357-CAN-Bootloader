The following setup is required to run the test projects

1. Host environment variable - The MW_INSTALL_DIR environment variable must be defined in the host environment to denote the home directory of the DMC installation.  (e.g. MW_INSTALL_DIR c:\users\user_X\dmc).  On a PC, this variable can be configured using the Control Panel ->System->Advanced->Environment Variables->User variables for user_X.   Click New and set the Variable name (MW_INSTALL_DIR) and the Variable value (c:\users\users_X\dmc).   Then Click OK.

Notes: 
a. It is recommended that each user on a particular system have their own library installation and variable definition so that they can modify their installation as needed without interfering with other users on the system.
b. The directory (c:\users\user_X\dmc) is arbitrary and should be changed to reflect the real library installation directory.

2. CCS4.x Linked Resources  THE MW_INSTALL_DIR path variable must be defined in CCS4.x.  This variable can be configured in CCS using Window->Preferences->General->Workspace->Linked Resources.  Click New  and set the Name (MW_INSTALL_DIR) and the Location (c:\users\users_X\dmc).   Then Click OK.
